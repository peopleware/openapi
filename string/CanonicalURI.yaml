  3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax ;3. Syntax
  Components](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3)), and without the build number. By convention, the
  canonical URI’s first segment is the name of the service in which the URI resides, followed by the relative URI of the
  resource in the API of that service.
