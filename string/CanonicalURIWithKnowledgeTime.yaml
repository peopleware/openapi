  A _canonical URI_ is the URI where are resource can be interacted with, without the scheme and authority (see [RFC
  3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax ;3. Syntax
  Components](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3)), and without the build number. By convention, the
  canonical URI’s first segment is the name of the service in which the URI resides, followed by the relative URI of the
  resource in the API of that service.


  The URI has an `at` qyuery parameter, expressing the knowledge time for which the service should return the resource.
  The value must be a moment in time, expressed as ISO-8601 in UTC ('Z'), to ms precision or more precise (should be μs
  precision).
