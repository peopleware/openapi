description: >-
  Belgian identification number of retirement _regulations_, attributed by Sigedis ([nl](https://sigedis.be/nl),
  [fr](https://sigedis.be/fr)).


  There is no formatting in this representation. In human communication, the Sigedis id is represented as 6 groups of 4
  digits (total 24), separated by `'-'` (/^(\d{4}-){5}\d{4}$/, e.g. `'1234-5678-9012-3456-7890-1234'`).


  _Regulation_ is a deliberately vague term. A sector retirement contract is a _regulation_, and is attributed a Sigedis
  id. For a MIPS retirement contract, the _participations in the contract of each separate employer_ are considered
  separate _regulations_ that are attributed each their own Sigedis id. Retirement contracts for a single employer each
  are separate _regulations_, and have a separate unique Sigdis id.


  Sigedis ids are not known yet when a regulation is created, and thus cannot function as business key. After creation
  of a _regulation_ it is _declared_ with Sigedis, and we receive a Sigedis id in response.


  Sigedis ids are unique. Sigedis ids do not change over the life of a regulation.
