  Unchangeable internal identification of a _regulation_ for communication with Sigedis.


  This consists of the CRN of the OFP that governs the contract as `registrant`, and the `registrantId`, which is an
  identification of the contract unqiue within the OFP.


  _Regulation_ is a deliberately vague term. A sector retirement contract is a _regulation_. For a MIPS retirement
  contract, the _participations in the contract of each separate employer_ are considered separate _regulations_.
  Retirement contracts for a single employer each are separate _regulations_.


  Sigedis regulation identifications have to be unique, and cannot change over the life of a regulation.


  Regulations are attributed a _Sigedis id_ by Sigedis, but this attribution is done after creation of a regulation, and
  its declaration with Sigedis. The Sigedis id therefor cannot be used as a business key. This value can, since the
  organization that manages the regulation can define it freely when the regulation is created. Once the Sigedis id is
  attributed, it can be used as identification in communication with Sigedis, but this value will continue to function
  in that role as well.

      Company Registration Number: Belgian identification of organizations.

      of an organization is handed out by the Belgian government, and uniquely identifies an organization. It is
      impossible, e.g., to legally do business in Belgium, or employ people, if the organization does not have a company
      registration number. The company registration number is also used as Belgian VAT identifier ("VAT Number").


      The company registration number of an organization never changes. If you encounter an organization with a
      different company registration number, it legally is a different organization. If you encounter an organization
      with the same company registration number, it legally is the same organization, although its name, address,
      etcetera, might have changed.
