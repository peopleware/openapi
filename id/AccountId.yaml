  Opaque id of an account.

  For manual interactions, the account refers to one specific natural person. The above implies that we have to be able
  to know from the value of this field as precise as possible to which organisation that natural person belongs. When we
  automatically proces data input files, we need to make sure that we use a different account per data source, and not
  one general account representing the overal import process.
