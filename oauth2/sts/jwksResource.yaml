  summary: Get JSON Web Key Set
  description: >-
    The `jwks` endpoint is used by resource services to obtain the public keys with which this STS signs access tokens
    returned from ['/token'](#operation/tokenGet). The structure of the response is defined by [RFC
    7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).


    The response **may** contain caching headers that allow to requester to cache responses for a rather long time, as
    the returned public keys are probably valid for a long time.

      x-summary: Returns the current JSON Web Key Set of this STS.
      description: >-
        A JWK Set is a JSON object that represents a set of JWKs. The JSON object MUST have a `keys` member, with its
        value being an array of JWKs.


        The member names within a JWK Set **must** be unique; JWK Set parsers **must** either reject JWK Sets with
        duplicate member names or use a JSON parser that returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as
        specified in [Section 15.12 of ECMAScript 5.1](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/#sec-15.12).


        Additional members can be present in the JWK Set; if not understood by implementations encountering them, they
        **must** be ignored. Parameters for representing additional properties of JWK Sets should either be registered
        in the IANA "JSON Web Key Set Parameters" registry established by [Section 8.4 of RFC
        7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-8.4) or be a value that contains a Collision-Resistant Name.


        Implementations **should** ignore JWKs within a JWK Set that use `kty` (key type) values that are not understood
        by them, that are missing required members, or for which values are out of the supported ranges.
