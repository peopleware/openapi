                - `invalid_request`:
                  The request is missing a required parameter, includes an
                  unsupported parameter value (other than grant type),
                  repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials,
                  utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the
                  client, or is otherwise malformed.
                - `invalid_client`:
                  Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no
                  client authentication included, or unsupported
                  authentication method).  The authorization server MAY
                  return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code to indicate
                  which HTTP authentication schemes are supported.  If the
                  client attempted to authenticate via the "Authorization"
                  request header field, the authorization server MUST
                  respond with an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code and
                  include the "WWW-Authenticate" response header field
                  matching the authentication scheme used by the client.
                - `invalid_grant`
                  The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization
                  code, resource owner credentials) or refresh token is
                  invalid, expired, revoked, does not match the redirection
                  URI used in the authorization request, or was issued to
                  another client.
                - `unauthorized_client`
                  The authenticated client is not authorized to use this
                  authorization grant type.
                - `unsupported_grant_type`
                  The authorization grant type is not supported by the
                  authorization server.
                - `invalid_scope`
                  The requested scope is invalid, unknown, malformed, or
                  exceeds the scope granted by the resource owner.
