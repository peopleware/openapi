    description: >-
      The `kty` (key type) parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm family used with the key, such as "RSA" or
      "EC".  `kty` values should either be registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Types" registry established by
      [JWA](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518) or be a value that contains a Collision- Resistant Name.  The `kty`
      value is a case-sensitive string.


      A list of defined `kty` values can be found in the IANA "JSON Web Key Types" registry established by
      [JWA](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518); the initial contents of this registry are the values defined in
      [Section 6.1 of JWA](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-6.1).


      The key type definitions include specification of the members to be used for those key types.  Members used with
      specific `kty` values can be found in the IANA "JSON Web Key Parameters" registry established by [Section 8.1 of
      RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-8.1).
