  summary: Contents of the Bearer Access Token
  description: >-
    This endpoint does not exist. This specification demonstrates the structure of the JWT Claims Set in Bearer Access
    Tokens returned by `POST /token`.

    The `access_token` returned by `POST /token` always is a JWT, as defined by [RFC
    7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). The JWT Claims Set is the JWS Payload.

    The JWT Claims Set represents a JSON object whose members are the claims conveyed by the JWT. The Claim Names within
    a JWT Claims Set **must** be unique; JWT parsers **must** either reject JWTs with duplicate Claim Names or use a
    JSON parser that returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as specified in [Section
    15.12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-15.12) ("The JSON Object") of [ECMAScript
    5.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#ref-ECMAScript).

    Although the set of claims that a JWT must contain to be considered valid is not standardized, this specification
    requires all Registered Claim Names defined in [RFC 7519 Section
    4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1). All other claims that are not understood by implementations
    **must** be ignored. Other registered claims can be found at the [IANA "JSON Web Token Claims"
    registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml).

    In this specification, a _NumericDate_ is a JSON numeric value representing the number of seconds from
    1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC until the specified UTC date/time, ignoring leap seconds. This is equivalent to the [IEEE
    Std 1003.1, 2013 Edition](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#ref-POSIX.1) definition "Seconds Since the Epoch", in
    which each day is accounted for by exactly 86400 seconds, other than that non-integer values can be
    represented.  See [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) for details regarding date/times in general and
    UTC in particular.
