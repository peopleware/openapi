      The `crv` (curve) parameter identifies the cryptographic curve used with the key. The curve values are defined in
      [DSS](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf).


      These values are registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Elliptic Curve" registry defined in [Section 7.6 of RFC
      7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-7.6). The `crv` value is a case-sensitive string.


      [SEC1](http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf) point compression is not supported for any of these three curves.


      See [RFC 7518 Section 6.2.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-6.2.1.1).

      The `x` (x coordinate) parameter contains the x coordinate for the Elliptic Curve point. It is represented as the
      _base64url_ encoding of the octet string representation of the coordinate, as defined in [Section 2.3.5 of
      SEC1]((http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf)). The length of this octet string **must** be the full size of a
      coordinate for the curve specified in the `crv` parameter. For example, if the value of `crv` is `P-521`, the
      octet string must be 66 octets long.

      The `y` (y coordinate) parameter contains the y coordinate for the Elliptic Curve point. It is represented as the
      _base64url_ encoding of the octet string representation of the coordinate, as defined in [Section 2.3.5 of
      SEC1]((http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf)). The length of this octet string **must** be the full size of a
      coordinate for the curve specified in the `crv` parameter. For example, if the value of `crv` is `P-521`, the
