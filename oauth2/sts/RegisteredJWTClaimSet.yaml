      The `iss` (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT. The processing of this claim is generally
      application specific. The `iss` value is a case-sensitive string containing a _StringOrURI_ value.
    example: https://www.ppwcode.org/openapi/common/sts
  sub:
    $ref: '../../id/AccountId.yaml'
    description: >-
      The `sub` (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. The claims in a JWT are
      normally statements about the subject. The subject value **must** either be scoped to be locally unique in the
      context of the issuer or be globally unique. The processing of this claim is generally application specific.

      The `aud` (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. Each principal intended to
      process the JWT **must** identify itself with a value in the audience claim.  If the principal processing the
      claim does not identify itself with a value in the `aud` claim, then the JWT **must** be rejected.  In the general
      case, the `aud` value is an array of case- sensitive strings, each containing a _StringOrURI_ value.  In the
      special case when the JWT has one audience, the `aud` value **may** be a single case-sensitive string containing a
      _StringOrURI_ value. The interpretation of audience values is generally application specific.

    description: >-
      The `exp` (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT **must not** be
      accepted for processing.  The processing of the `exp` claim requires that the current date/time **must** be before
      the expiration date/time listed in the `exp` claim. Implementers **may** provide for some small leeway, usually no
      more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  Its value **must** be a number containing a _NumericDate_
      value.
    example: 1612343692
  nbf:
    type: number
    minimum: 0
    description: >-
      The `nbf` (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT **must not** be accepted for
      processing.  The processing of the `nbf` claim requires that the current date/time **must** be after or equal to
      the not-before date/time listed in the `nbf` claim.  Implementers **may** provide for some small leeway, usually
      no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  Its value **must** be a number containing a _NumericDate
      value_.
    example: 1612343392
  iat:
    type: number
    minimum: 0
    description: >-
      The `iat` (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued.  This claim can be used to determine
      the age of the JWT.  Its value **must** be a number containing a _NumericDate_ value.
    example: 1612343392
  jti:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    description: >-
      The `jti` (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The identifier value **must** be assigned in a
      manner that ensures that there is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally assigned to a
      different data object; if the application uses multiple issuers, collisions **must** be prevented among values
      produced by different issuers as well. The `jti` claim can be used to prevent the JWT from being replayed. The
      `jti` value is a case- sensitive string.

      We suggest using a UUID.
