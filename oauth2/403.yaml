x-summary: >-
  The request requires higher privileges than provided by the access token
description: >-
  The returned `x-flow-id` and `x-mode` header values are the same as in the request, if they are available.


  If there is no `x-flow-id` in the request, or if it is malformed, the service generates a random UUID itself, and
  returns that. Therefor, a `401` response always has an `x-flow-id` header. (A missing `x-flow-id` in the request would
  normally result in a `400` response, but authNZ takes precedence.)


  If there is a valid `authorization` token, but there is no `x-mode` in the request, or if it is malformed,
  authorization is impossible, and a `403` is returned. Since we will never return invalid values, in this case, there
  is no `x-mode` header in the response. If there is a valid `authorization` token, and there is a valid `x-mode` in the
  request, but the resource action is not authorized for other reasons, the response `x-mode` header contains the
  `x-mode` value from the request.
