  title: ppwcode STS with RAA
  description: >-
    Spec for an OAuth2 Secure Token Service (STS), according to [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749),
    extended with support for Resource Action Authorization (RAA) version 2.

    To learn about OAuth2, we found ["OAuth 2.0 Simplified" by Aaron Parecki](https://www.oauth.com/) to be a very good
    resource.
