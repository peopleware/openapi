  The returned `x-flow-id` and `x-mode` header values are the same as in the request, if they are available. If there is
  no `x-flow-id` in the request, or if it is malformed, the service generates a random UUID itself, and returns that.


  A missing `x-flow-id` or `x-mode` header in the request would normally result in a `400` response, but authNZ takes
  precedence.
