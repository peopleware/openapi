      List of items that match the search, ordered by relevance. The list has `per_page` or fewer items.


      Items identify the type of resource they represent (`discriminator`), a link to the indexed version of the found
      resource (`href`), and information for humans to recognize the found resource.


      The list has the requested number of items, except for the first and last page. The `href.first` page can be
      empty, or have fewer elements than `per_page`. The `href.last` page can have fewer reference in the response than
      `per_page`, but cannot be empty. Other pages have exactly the `per_page` as number of items.

            Relative URI where the found resource's information is located. The `at` parameter _must_ be the same as the
            value of the `x-date` response header.


            Users need to be directed to the version returned by the search index, and not an earlier or more recent
            version. The search engine updates, eventually, after a few seconds. If a more recent version is available
            in the meantime, the user interface makes it possible for the user to navigate to that version.

            Type of the indexed resource.


            This enables users to search only on particular resource type. The type is qualified with the service name,
            to avoid name clashes (slash-separated).
