      List of items that match the search, ordered by relevance. The list has `per_page` or fewer items.


      Items identify the type of resource they represent (`discriminator`), a link to the indexed version of the found
      resource (`href`), and information for humans to recognize the found resource. The entries can have different
      `structureVersions`, even for the same `discriminator`. The precise structure of each entry, beyond the base
      properties, is a contract between the service in which the resource resides and clients of the search service.
      This is opaque to the search service, which acts as intermediate.


      The list has the requested number of items, except for the first and last page. The `href.first` page can be
      empty, or have fewer elements than `per_page`. The `href.last` page can have fewer reference in the response than
      `per_page`, but cannot be empty. Other pages have exactly the `per_page` as number of items.

        The resource's search document with the most up-to-date information, i.e., up-to-date up until, but not
        including, `x-date`.


        This is a contract between this service and clients of the search service. Specific properties are added for
        different `discriminators`. When returned by the search service, the property `href` is added. This is the
        canonical URI of the found resource, including an `at` query parameter, that refers to the precise version of
        the found resource that was indexed.

            Type of the indexed resource.


            This enables users to search only on particular resource type. The type is qualified with the service name,
            to avoid name clashes (slash-separated).

            Canonical URI where the found resource's information is located, at the version that was indexed (`at`
            parameter _must_ be included).


            Users need to be directed to the version returned by the search index, and not an earlier or more recent
            version. The search engine updates, eventually, after a few seconds. If a more recent version is available
            in the meantime, the user interface makes it possible for the user to navigate to that version.


            A _canonical URI_ is the URI where are resource can be interacted with, without the scheme and authority
            (see [RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax ;3. Syntax
            Components](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3)), and without the build number. By convention,
            the canonical URI’s first segment is the name of the service in which the URI resides, followed by the
            relative URI of the resource in the API of that service.


            The URI has an `at` qyuery parameter, expressing the knowledge time for which the service should return the
            resource. The value must be a moment in time, expressed as ISO-8601 in UTC ('Z'), to ms precision or more
            precise (should be μs precision).
