    description: >-
      Opaque id of the account that executed the resource action that `put`ed or `post`ed this item version.


      For manual interactions, the account refers to one specific natural person. The above implies that we have to be
      able to know from the value of this field as precise as possible to which organisation that natural person
      belongs. When we automatically proces data input files, we need to make sure that we use a different account per
      data source, and not one general account representing the overal import process.
