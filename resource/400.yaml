  The returned `x-flow-id` and `x-mode` header values are the same as in the request, if they are available. If there is
  no `x-flow-id` in the request, or if it is malformed, the service generates a random UUID itself, and returns that.


  If there are authNZ issues, those take precedence, and a `401` or `403` is returned instead.
headers:
  x-flow-id:
    schema:
      $ref: '../id/UUID.yaml'
  x-mode:
    schema:
      $ref: '../id/mode.yaml'
  x-date:
    schema:
      $ref: 'date.yaml'
