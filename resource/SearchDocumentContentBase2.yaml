  The resource's search document with the most up-to-date information, i.e., up-to-date up until, but not including,
  `x-date`.


  This is a contract between this service and clients of the search service. Specific properties are added for different
  `discriminators`. When returned by the search service, the property `href` is added. This is the canonical URI of the
  found resource, including an `at` query parameter, that refers to the precise version of the found resource that was
  indexed.

      avoid name clashes (slash-separated).
