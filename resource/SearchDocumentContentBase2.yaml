  The resource's search document with the most up-to-date information, i.e., up-to-date up until, but not including,
  `x-date`.


  This is a contract between this service and clients of the search service. Specific properties are added for different
  `discriminators`. When returned by the search service, the property `href` is added. This is the canonical URI of the
  found resource, including an `at` query parameter, that refers to the precise version of the found resource that was
  indexed.

      This enables users to search only on particular resource type. The type is qualified with the service name, to
      avoid name clashes (slash-separated).
