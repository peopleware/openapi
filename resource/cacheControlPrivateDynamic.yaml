  Directs the end-user's browser to cache responses for a short while, on a human time-scale.


  See [RFC 7234 Section 5.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2.2).


  The `private` directive ensures the response is only cached by the browser's cache ([RFC 7234 Section
  5.2.2.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2.2.6)).


  Users, on the same computer, on the same browser, will not get fresh data from the service when they ask for the same
  data during this short period, as long as they did not perform an
  [unsafe](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.1) HTTP action.
