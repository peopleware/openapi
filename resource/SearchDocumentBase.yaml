              Relative URI where the found affiliate's information is located. The `at` parameter _must_ be the same as
              the value of the `x-date` response header.


              Users need to be directed to the version returned by the search index, and not an earlier or more recent
              version. The search engine updates, eventually, after a few seconds. If a more recent version is available
              in the meantime, the user interface makes it possible for the user to navigate to that version.
            example: ?at=2021-01-19T17:14:18.482Z
