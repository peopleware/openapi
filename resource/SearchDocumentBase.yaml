          Unique identifier of the search result. Can only contain alphanumeric chars and dashes (-), underscores (_)
          and equals signs (=).
                 Can also not start with dash, underscore or equals sign.

                 By convention this is the href value, without any parameters, converted to lowercase, with all invalid
          characters replaced with underscore (_),
                 and the first character stripped if it was a dash, underscore or equals sign.
