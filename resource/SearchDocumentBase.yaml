  The resource's search document with the most up-to-date information, i.e., up-to-date up until, but not including,
  `x-date`.

    description: >-
      Relative URI where the found affiliate's information is located. The `at` parameter _must_ be the same as the
      value of the `x-date` response header.


      Users need to be directed to the version returned by the search index, and not an earlier or more recent version.
      The search engine updates, eventually, after a few seconds. If a more recent version is available in the meantime,
      the user interface makes it possible for the user to navigate to that version.

      Type of the indexed resource.


      This enables users to search only on particular resource type. The type is qualified with the service name, to
      avoid name clashes (slash-separated).
