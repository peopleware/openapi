  Wrapper around the search result (which is returned to the client when the resource is found), with information for a
  search index.


  It contains strings for which the resource this is a search document for can be found by, and the `content` that is to
  be sent to the client. The resource this is a search document for can be found with an exact match on the strings in
  `exact` or `toOneAssociations`, and by a fuzzy search on the strings in `fuzzy`. Some strings might appear in both.


  `fuzzy`, `toOneAssociations` or `exact` may be empty, but not all of them.


  Search results can be limited to selected types with an exact match on `content.discriminator`. The found resource can
  be retrieved in the indexed version at `href`.

      Relative URI where the found resource's information is located. The `at` parameter _must_ be the same as the value
      of the `x-date` response header.


      Users need to be directed to the version returned by the search index, and not an earlier or more recent version.
      The search engine updates, eventually, after a few seconds. If a more recent version is available in the meantime,
      the user interface makes it possible for the user to navigate to that version.

          This enables users to search only on particular resource type. The type is qualified with the service name, to
          avoid name clashes (slash-separated).
