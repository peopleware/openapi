    - description: Get the information we believed to be true at `at`.


        The semantic maximum, and default, is `now` (we cannot predict knowledge the system will have in the future),
        which returns the most recent knowledge. This is not enforced in the service however. Otherwise, we might
        generate unnecessary problems with clock differences between client and service computers. A value `> now` will
        be interpreted as `now`. As far as we know, the knowledge in the future will be the knowledge we have `now`.


        The returned resource will have a `createdAt <= at` always. If `at` is before the creation of the resource,
        `404` is returned.
