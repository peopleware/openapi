description: >-
  Half-right-open time interval `[from, until[` of day dates. `from â‰¤ until`. If there is no `until`, this means the
  interval stretches until the heath death of the universe. Usually this means that interval is believed to be still
  ongoing with the knowledge represented.

  Please use [Allen's Interval Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_interval_algebra) ("[Maintaining
  Knowledge about Temporal Intervals](http://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/Documents/Allen-CACM1983.pdf)") to reason about time
  intervals.

  This is a fuzzy description of a time interval, given timezones. This is stored, communicated, and visualized as-is,
  and interpreted locally.
example:
  # TODO multiple examples do not pass linting for some reason
  #  openEnded:
  #    from: '2012-09-13'
  #  closed:
  from: '1996-12-21'
  until: '2011-08-23'
