  Half-right-open time interval `[start, end[` of day dates. `start ≤ end`. If there is no `end`, this means the
  interval stretches until the heath death of the universe. Usually this means that interval is believed to be still
  ongoing with the knowledge represented.


  Please use [Allen's Interval Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_interval_algebra) ("[Maintaining
  Knowledge about Temporal Intervals](http://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/Documents/Allen-CACM1983.pdf)") to reason about time
  intervals.
